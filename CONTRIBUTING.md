### Contributing to Nimbella Redisqlite

We are thankful that you're taking the time to read this contribution guide, and we are excited to work with you toward a positive contribution to the project. This document outlines the process for contributing to the project.

### We welcome all contributions.

Contributions come in many different forms, not just code. Here are some quick tips:
- **Improving project documentation**: If you found a typo, just make a pull request with the fix. If you are planning to write new documentation for a command set or a command, please [open an issue first](../../issues/new/choose). This gives us a chance to provide guidance when necessary.
- **Requesting a new feature or command**: [Open a "Feature Request"](../../issues/new?template=feature_request.md) and fill out details appropriately.
- **Changing existing code**: Please open an appropriate [issue](../../issues/new/choose) describing your proposed change before you create a pull request. This ensures consensus and allows us to work together toward positive outcomes.

### Contribution guidelines.

- We have a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please review it so you are familiar with the project values.
- You agree that your contributions will be licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE).
- When you open a pull request with your contributions, **you are certifying that you wrote the code** in the corresponding patch pursuant to the [Developer Certificate of Origin](#developer-certificate-of-origin) included below for your reference.
