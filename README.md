# Redisqlite

A fresh implementation of the sqlite module for redis.

Truly open source, no string attached, no phone-home requirements, no licensing per instance/hour and so on.

# Installation

## How to build and run locally 

Instructions for OSX, it should work on any other unix-like environment with Go and Redis.

You need go 1.15, install it (OSX: `brew install go`)

You need redis of course, install it  (OSX: `brew install redis`)

Then run `make start`

On another terminal connect to redis with `redis-cli`  and try:

```
$ redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> sqlexec "create table t(i int)"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> sqlexec "insert into t(i) values(1),(2),(3)"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> sqlmap 0 "select * from t"
[{"i":1},{"i":2},{"i":3}]
127.0.0.1:6379> sqlmap 1 "select * from t"
[{"i":1}]
127.0.0.1:6379>
```

## Build and start a docker image

You need docker up and running, of course.

Use:

```
make image
make imagestart
```

It will build and start a local image called `redisqlite` with redis including the module.
